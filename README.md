# PowerNSXT

PowerNSXT is the community build version of the PowerShell cmdlets for VMware NSX-T.
The native NSX-T PowerShell module is too complex (with only 3 cmdlets), so I build my own PowerShell Module for NSX-T.

download the .psm1 file and install it with "install-module powernsxt.psm1".
This module doesn't require PowerCLI to be installed, as it only uses native powershell cmdlets.
